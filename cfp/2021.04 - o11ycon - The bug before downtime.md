# The bug before downtime

## Conference
o11ycon

## Abstract
T'was the night before launch and all through the app
Not a ticket was open, not even a slack.
The backlogs were sorted in Jira with care,
In hopes that no bugs would show themselves there.
The pagers were quiet next to devs in their beds;
While SLO graphs danced close to the edge.
And SRE wake putting finishing touches,
On one last push with no repercussions.
When out of the alert arose such a clatter,
I sprang to my laptop to see what was the matter.
