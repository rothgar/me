# From container to cloud

## Abstract
I learned containers to solve problems with repeatable, isolated application deployments.
Now individual applications aren't a problem and my environment is much more complex.
Containers has proven to be the little standard that could adapt.
No matter if you're new to containers or an experienced user we'll look at how containers are used for packaging more than traditional web apps.
