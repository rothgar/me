# 2019.11 - Rejekts - How-to Prepare for Launch

## Description

Launching a product is stressful for people and infrastructure.
Justin will show you what to consider before a highly anticipated product launch so you can be prepared for the unknown.
He will provide examples from a recent service offering as well as discuss lessons learned.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

The ecosystem currently focuses too much on tools. By providing a real world example from a service that does not use Kubernetes I hope to help people be successful no matter what their technology stacks look like.
Disney+ launches the week before Kubecon and I will show what we did to prepare as well as what expected and unexpected things happened during launch.
I might not be able to directly say the example service is Disney+ (Disney legal would probably say no), but I will extract the things we found beneficial and give some real world examples of why.

## Status
accepted (Disney PR cancelled)
